ðŸ“¬ drop-in mailer API	ðŸ“¬

## motivation ##

Often times, you want a standard API for mail operations from a system.  The
main use cases are:

  1. Mail reports and populate particular templates with data.
  2. Mail arbitrary people.
  3. Get system user's mail (as html, json, whatever)
  4. Delete a system user's mail.
  5. Forward a system user's mail.
  6. Secure the API with an API key for all operations.

* 0box aims to provide API endpoints for managing mbox formatted mail.

  For documentation on these API endpoints, see [services](docs/services.md).

* Area of focus:
  - systems mail API.
  - app integration.

Further [rationale](docs/rationale.md) provided.
